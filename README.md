# PropertyList
Create and access property lists using Swift.

The Plist class wraps valid property list types and provides creation and query APIs similar to those provided by the popular JSON serialization library SwiftyJSON. The class is written using Swift 2.0 syntax and requires Xcode 7.0 or later to build.
